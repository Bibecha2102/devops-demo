# How DevOps Improves Software Delivery

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

According to *The DevOps Handbook*, DevOps improves software delivery by:
- Increasing deployment frequency.
- Reducing the failure rate of new releases.
- Shortening the lead time between fixes.
- Improving mean time to recovery.

These benefits help teams deliver value to customers faster and more reliably.
